\section{\Large Summary}
I am a graduate student at the \textit{\textbf{Predictive Science Lab}} at \textbf{Purdue University}. My research deals with high dimensional Uncertainty Quantification. Learning high dimensional functions is a problem of massive importance in various areas of engineering (flow in porous media, contact mechanics in granular crystals, molecular dynamics, for instance). At the same time, it is a computationally intensive problem and the computational cost rises exponentially with an increase in the number of dimensions (\textit{curse of dimensionality}). We seek to devise probabilistic surrogate models based on Bayesian principles that reduce the computational expense of learning these high dimensional mappings and quantifies model-form uncertainties. In order to do so, we utilize \textit{Gaussian Processes (GP)}, a non-parametric kernel based regression methodology. We also seek to understand how the model form uncertainty propagates through the model (\textit{Uncertainty Propagation} problem).

\section{\Large Work\ Experience}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Scooters India Ltd.} \hfill December 2012 \\ Worked on a project entitled "Complete Manufacturing and Assembly of a reverse gear sprocket". This project involved studying various stages involved in the manufacturing of a reverse gear sprocket and its eventual assembly into a typical Indian 3 wheeler auto-rickshaw.
\item \textit{Hindustan Aeronautics Limited} \hfill May 2012 - June 2012 \\ As a vocational trainee at HAL's \textit{Transport Aircraft Division} in Kanpur(India), I was given a hands on experience in the operations of various departments within the factory including the Dornier shop , the loom shop , the hydraulics shop , the machining lab , the sheet metal and production lab , the CAD/CAM lab and the hydraulics and rotatables lab.
\end{itemize}
